17;18;20171109;Good morning, Chief O'Hara, Duckburg police department. I ordered 200 phones Superphone 5 and only 100 were delivered. Now the missing 100 have arrived. But it's the wrong model. So what do I do? Aha, send them back. And when do I get the missing phones? What do you mean you can't say? That kind of service is ridiculous. I will cancel the contract. Good bye.
