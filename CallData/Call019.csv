3;19;20171206;Hi there, this is Daisy Duck speaking. The coverage around my house is very poor. Sometimes I can't even get a call. And people keep ringing me and they can't reach me even though the mobile is right here on the table and switched on. Can you fix that? I live in Quack Street, you have my data. Pardon? Yes you can send me an email, you have my address? Good. Thank you.
