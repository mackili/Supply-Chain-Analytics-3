2;48;20190225;Scrooge here, my useless nephew Donald just showed me his phone bill for the corporate phone I granted him in a moment of weekness. This bill is too much, we need to fix it. What do you mean you can't do anything? I want this bill to be canceled, I am the owner of the company. You have to talk to management? I am management. Ah, thank you. That is excellent service. Good bye and have a nice day working for me.
