29;55;20190507;Hi, I am April from Duckburg. I got myself a prepaid mobile from your company and now all of a sudden I can't charge it any more. What is going on? You mean I have to register, all Ducks and Mice with prepaid phones are required to register. But I am not a terror duck. What do you mean whether I have anything to hide? This is not good, bye.
