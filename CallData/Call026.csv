3;26;20180428;This is Daisy Duck again. I complained about the poor reception ages ago, you promised to get back to me which you didn't and yesterday I was promised a call back which, of course, didn't materialise and now I am really fed up. This ruffles my feathers. Pardon? Where I live? Quack Street, for the zillionth time. No I don't want a call back. I want a decent reception. Good bye and thank you for nothing.
