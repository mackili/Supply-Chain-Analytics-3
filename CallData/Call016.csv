19;16;20171014;Hi, this is Bouncer Beagle. I ordered a phone from you when I signed the contract. And it hasn't arrived yet. Your service sucks. Where is my phone? Ah, I see. Shortage of the model. Why did the service agent at your outlet didn't tell me? When will it arrive? Next week. OK, let's hope for the best.
