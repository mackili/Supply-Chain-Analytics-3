37;66;20190715;Roberta speaking, good afternoon. I need a new display for my Superphone S3, it broke. Hm, No displays for the old S3 available any more. That is too bad. Can I swap my phone? I can only if I upgrade from the base rate plan to the international super saver roaming rate. But look, I am a simple duck, I don't travel that much. I simply don't need the super saver roaming rate, I need a new phone. Stop talking about that roaming, I don't need it, I need a phone because my display broke. Sorry but your service is useless, good bye.
