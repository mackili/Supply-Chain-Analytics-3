3;25;20180427;Daisy Duck speaking. I live in Quack Street and complained about the poor reception ages, litterally ages ago. Your colleague promised to do something about it and that I would get an email from your customer service. I never got an email and the reception is still abominable. I will get a call back? Today? Oh, sounds good. See you.
