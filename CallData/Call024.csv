7;24;20180414;Good morning. Grandma Duck speaking. I am on the supersaver rate plan and I got a smart phone. But I have to say the display is so small, I can't see it. Do you have something bigger? No, I don't want a tablet. Superphone 8, silver hair edition with extra large charcters. Sounds good. Where can I exchange my phone? OK, I will go to the outlet. Bye.
