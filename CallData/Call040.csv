35;40;20181025;Good evening, Donna on the phone. I just got my bill and the roaming fees you charge are preposterous. We need to fix this. What? You can't fix it? What do you mean I should ring less from abroad. I have a phone for ringing. Your rates are unaceptable. And your coverage, by the way, sucks too. I live near Duck Street and somertimes there is no reception. Goodbye.
