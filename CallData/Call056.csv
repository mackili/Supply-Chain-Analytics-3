2;56;20190530;Good morning, this is Scooge. I want to give prepaid phones to my grand nephews, do you have a cheap rate plan? I see, you want to rob me, make me end up as a pauper. OK, I take the lowest rate. They have to show up at your outlet to register? Where is the nearest outlet? Scrooge Wharf? Of course I know that. Bye.
