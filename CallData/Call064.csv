33;64;20190715;Hi there, Rockerduck speaking. The memory on my Superphone S7 is full and I need additional space. Yes, I know about the sim card, but I am already using a sim card. Can I insert yet another one? No? What do you mean by No? Your lousy little outlet is owned by Scrooge itsn't it? So you are discriminating against me, the great Rockerduck, hm? I will sue you until Scrooge is blue in the face, good bye.
