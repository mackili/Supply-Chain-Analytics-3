25;4;20170203;Hi Gyro speaking. I wanted to complain about the storage capacity of your S9 model. The memory is simply too small, horrible. And I can't upgrade it, I mean I can't insert a sim card. What do you mean what do I need the memory for? I need to store data. So you won't help me? What is this customer service there fore? To generate voice clips for a lecture or to help me with my phone? Aha, thank you for your candid response.
