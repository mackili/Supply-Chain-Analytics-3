24;86;20190919;Gyro Gearloose, good day. My phone was subjected to an electromagnetic shock and doesn't work any more. Can I have it fixed or is it burnt? Probably burnt, you are saying. Hm. Can I get a new phone on my rate plan. Only if I extend by three more years? What would I get for that? Superphone S9? Deal, extend me. Bye.
