1;15;20171008;Good day, Donald speaking. I would ask about the coverage in the Quack Street neighbourhood. Your coverage is generally quite good, but over there, particularly near Daisy's house, it is not so hot. Do you have any plans to improve on that? Hmm, I see. Well when do you intend to improve the coverage? Next year? Well, that is at least a time frame. Thank you, bye.
