17;17;20171025;Good morning, Chief O'Hara speaking, Duckburg police department. I ordered 200 mobile phones for my officers and only 100 were delivered and they did not contain the software I asked for. What is going on here? So you are not the right person to talk to, who is? So I should call my corporate account manager. OK. Have a nice day and stay clear of the Beagle Boys.
