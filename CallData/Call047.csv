35;47;20190223;Good evening, Donna Duck on the phone. I have been complaining about the poor coverage around Quack Street. You did not fix it for ages. How come? No, I don't want a call back from a service agent, I want to know when the reception in my neighbourhood will be ok. You can't tell me? Thank you for nothing, good bye.
