8;9;20170401;Mickey speaking. You charged me 500 Dollars in roaming fees for my calls from Quackistan. That is not right. Those fees are atrocious. What do you mean what do I do in Quackistan? I was chasing the Beagle Boys and you should get decent rates for roaming fees. Not everybody stays in Duckburg all the time. So you can't help me with the fees? That is not right, bye.
