2;46;20190219;This is Scooge speaking, good morning. I just saw my last bill with the roaming fees. They are unacceptable. This is ridiculously high-priced. What do you mean talk less from abroad. I need to supervise my businesses while I am abroad. Pardon? What do you mean by tax deductible? That does not make your bill smaller. I will cancel my contract. I know I am the owner of your company, but let other people pay too much, I quit.
