5;1;20170108;I am Dewey, I am on the young customer rate plan. Last week, I bought a brand new Superphone S9. However, upon one week of using it, problems started to appear. The flash of the camera is no longer working and also the monitor is getting blurry which makes it difficult for me to see the SMS messages clearly. I was very surprised to discover such problems in quite an expensive model. Naturally, I returned the mobile phone at your store to be replaced with a new one but one of your sales staff told me that they will send it to my home address within one week. However, two weeks have passed without me receiving any replacement. I am very upset for your poor service. In this regard, I insist on getting a refund of my full payment if the replacement will not arrive within one more week.
