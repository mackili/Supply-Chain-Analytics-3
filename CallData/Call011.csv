2;11;20170830;Good night, Scrooge here. After a refreshing bath in my money bin I discovered that my display screen is broken. Must have been one of these coins. Can you swap it? What? Pay for it and that ridiculous price? I am not my nephew who throws money out by the window. I need to economise. Is there a cheaper option? What do you mean by pricing guidelines by your new corporate owner. Who is your owner? Oh, I see. Well, thank you and good night.
