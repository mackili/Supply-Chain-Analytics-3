21;2;20170110;Good morning, Bigtime Beagle speaking. I wanted to enquire, whether there is a cheaper rate plan. Your rates are atrocious. No I didn't break into Scrooge's money bin. So I need a lower rate. What do you mean I can't change while I am on the fixed term? Do you want me to break into your money bin? Your service is deficient. Yes, the phone is ok I admit. But the service sucks.
