40;87;20190923;Good night, Avenger Duck here. I need a new phone, one with stealth properties and encryption. What do you mean you don't have that? Your are a phone company, aren't you. I need a phone that changes ist frequency every millisecond and does strong 256 bit encryption. You don't have that, unbelievable. That is really poor technology. Bye.
